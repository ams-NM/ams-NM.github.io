# Problem üêû
- Observer reported invalid reading on VIS @RWY16.
- "MOR Underrange" warning  activated.
- Connected to LT31 and found receiver signal was 0%.
- AOCC then reported something wrong with the pole.
- On site found that the receiver pole of LT31 @RWY 16 tilted.
## Preparation
### How
- One of the 3 foundation screws was broken.
- E&M arranged Foucs to help moving the pole back to vertical position. Then welded the broken screws & add 3 angle bars to the bottom.
- Worked till 20:00.
- The next day:
	- Performed "Fine Alignment" , "Calibration" and then "reset".
	- All alarms were cleared, and the reading resumed normal.
### Who
- [[Aaron]], [[Eric]]
