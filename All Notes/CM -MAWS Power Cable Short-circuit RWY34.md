# Problem üêû
- The circuit breaker in GP station tripped.
- Big 4 found that the neutral wire from AWOS at WRY34 was short-circuited.
- Thunderstorm was hoisted when we were about to go on site. Waited for about half an hour.

- It took quit a while to locate the problem.
- It was the power connection of MAWS from term-box to the equipment cabinet.
- Removed the cable together with the connector, went out to hardware stores and looked for the same item with no luck.
- Disassembled the connector and found that the problem was in the cable, not the connector.
- Removed the cable from the connector, and connected a new stretch of power cable to it.
- Restored this power cable and wind data resumed normally.
