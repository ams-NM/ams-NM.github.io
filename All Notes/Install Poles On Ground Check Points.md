### [[2023-08-24 Thu]] On-site Survey
- Go on site and show [[Focus]] and guys from [[CAM E&M]] the 4 points.
- [[Focus]] placed a large stone on each point.
## How
- ~~Use short poles(The ones are used to seperate safty and non-safty area) instead of the concrete plates.~~
- [[Focus]] will put a short wooden pole near each of the concrete plate, so that we can find them more easily in the future.

## Why
- [[Ground Check Points]] on grass area were built with concrete plates.
- They are really difficult to find due to totally covered by grass.
- And they were broken and would be lost in near future.
