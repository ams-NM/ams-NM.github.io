### [[2023-08-24 Thu]] On-site Survey
- Go on site and show [[Focus]] the points.

## How
- Use short poles(The ones are used to seperate safty and non-safty area) instead of the concrete plates. 

## Why
- Ground check points on grass area were built with concrete plates.
- They are really difficult to find due to totally covered by grass.
- And they were broken and would be lost in near future.
