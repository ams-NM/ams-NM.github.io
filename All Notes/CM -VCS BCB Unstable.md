# Problem 🐞
- Found error logs of BCB 02/11 during weekly PM.
## Preparation

## Log
### [[2022-10-13 Thu]]
- Found 2 spare rack fans, put them on service for testing.
- Error showed up just after the replacing of rack fans on 02/11.
- So the problem might come from bad contact of the slot.
### [[2022-09-15 Thu]]
- Swapped with BCB 01/08 in order to see if error symptom follows.
- Issued IMO for a new BCB card.
